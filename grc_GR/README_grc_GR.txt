Based on the "Ancient Greek Spell Checker" plugin (http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/ancientgreekspellchecker) for Open Office version 2.1.5 (15/02/2010), originally published under LGPL, GPL.

The Spell Checker was based on Morpheus word list (provided by the Perseus Project) and is considered an alpha version.

Known issues:
 a. Apostrophe is considered an "ignored character".
 b. Retrieval of long words is quite slow.
